# The Composable Interface Pattern
## Building Agentic Systems from Stable Contracts and Simple Services

### 6. What Comes Next

This system wasn’t built to be a thought experiment. It was built to run. And it does. The ideas I’ve outlined here are backed by real, working code — small, composable services and a lightweight orchestration platform that anyone can run locally or deploy across a distributed environment.

#### 🧪 Code, Kits, and Tools
What I’ll be releasing shortly includes:

- A complete Node.js implementation of the three core services:
  - `discovery`
  - `shared-state`
  - `job-control`
- A starter set of **composable services** that follow the `/execute`, `/repeat`, `/revert` contract
- Sample **job definitions** that show conditional logic, retries, and reversibility
- A growing library of **patterns and templates** for designing your own services and workflows

All of it will be open source, modular, and extensible.

#### 🧰 What You Can Do With It
If you want to:
- Build automation pipelines without writing orchestration code
- Create agent-like behavior without deploying AI infrastructure
- Design services once and reuse them across hundreds of workflows
- Teach new developers the fundamentals of flow, state, and coordination

...this platform can help.

I’ve been using it to explore ideas around fault recovery, composable DevOps steps, long-running transactions, and even dynamic API generation. The flexibility is in the form. Once you adopt the contract, the rest follows.

#### 🛤️ Where This Leads
This is just the beginning.

There’s potential to build:
- **Visual job editors** that let humans compose agents
- **LLM-based planners** that synthesize jobs on demand
- **Runtime diagnostics** that trace and debug long-running jobs
- **Composable marketplaces** where services can be discovered, invoked, and recombined live

The groundwork is in place. The pattern is repeatable. And I’m excited to see where others take it.

If you’re building something in this space — or want to — let’s talk. This system is designed to be used, extended, and evolved. It works. And it’s just getting started.

### Conclusion

The Composable Interface Pattern isn’t about enforcing minimalism for its own sake — it’s about creating room to grow. By narrowing the interface and stabilizing the orchestration model, I’ve opened up space for dynamic behavior, adaptive planning, and true long-term reuse.

This isn’t the end state of anything. It’s a foundation — a composable substrate for systems that are built to evolve. Whether you’re designing services, crafting jobs, or thinking about the future of agentic platforms, this model is a place to start.

It works now. It scales later. And if I’ve done my job, it invites you to build forward from here.
