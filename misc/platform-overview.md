# A New Operating Platform for Uncoordinated Services

## The Big Picture

With just three components:

- `discovery` — to find services by tag or profile
- `shared-state` — to store and share intermediate data
- `job-control` — to declare, execute, and manage multi-step jobs

…you’ve built a **complete platform for orchestrating workflows across uncoordinated services**.

---

## Key Insight

Any service that implements:

```
POST /execute
POST /repeat
POST /revert
```

…can be safely enlisted in jobs **without requiring any coordination**, configuration, or coupling between services.

This means:
- Services can be developed by **different teams**
- Hosted on **different infrastructures**
- Found and enlisted **at runtime**
- And still participate in coherent, reliable workflows

---

## Jobs as Scripts

A `job-control` document is essentially a **declarative script**:

- Steps are **sequenced**
- Tasks are **discovered** dynamically
- Data is passed **through shared-state**
- Errors are handled with **reversion**
- No service needs to know about the rest of the job

This is **scriptable computation** across the open web.

## An Open, Composable Service Ecosystem

Just like shell scripts let you chain commands on Unix…

This platform lets you chain **web services**, even if:
- You didn’t write them
- You don’t own them
- You don’t trust their internal logic

As long as they follow the interface contract, they’re **safe to mix**.

## Why This Is Powerful

| Feature | Benefit |
|---------|---------|
| ✅ Minimal contract | Services stay simple and single-purpose |
| ✅ Global addressability | Works across networks, domains, teams |
| ✅ Late binding | Discover and use services at runtime |
| ✅ Decentralized authorship | No coordination required |
| ✅ Secure reversibility | Every action can be undone (or noop'd) |

---

## What You’ve Created

An **execution environment** for:

- Declarative jobs
- Dynamically discovered services
- Shared affordance-based memory
- Fault-tolerant orchestration

This is not just microservice wiring.

This is a **web-native scriptable platform**.
