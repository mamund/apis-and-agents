Absolutely — there are several other agentic platforms, protocols, and frameworks emerging that are worth mentioning alongside MCP, LangChain, CrewAI, and Auto-GPT. Here’s a curated list of **notable and distinct platforms** that are pushing boundaries in this space:

---

## ⚙️ **Agentic Platforms, Protocols, and Frameworks**

### 🔸 **Message-Centric Protocol (MCP)**  
- **Project site:** [https://mcp.dev](https://mcp.dev) *(still forming, mostly GitHub-based)*  
- A decentralized protocol for coordinating autonomous agents via message-passing and affordance negotiation.
- Originated from work by Simon Willison, Jonathan Dunlap, and others.

---

### 🔸 **Agncy (formerly AgentOps)**  
- **Website:** [https://agncy.ai](https://agncy.ai)  
- Focused on giving developers a toolkit for managing and deploying LLM agents — with plans, tasks, and memory.
- Works well with LangChain or vanilla OpenAI APIs.

---

### 🔸 **Autogen (by Microsoft Research)**  
- **GitHub:** [https://github.com/microsoft/autogen](https://github.com/microsoft/autogen)  
- A multi-agent orchestration framework with “AgentScript”-like plans and chat-based reasoning patterns.
- Great for simulating collaboration between multiple LLM personas.

---

### 🔸 **CrewAI**  
- Already in your draft — built for building collaborative multi-agent systems with defined roles and communication.

---

### 🔸 **LangChain**  
- Also already included — essentially the foundation many other agent frameworks build on.

---

### 🔸 **Auto-GPT**  
- Also in your draft — one of the original open-source projects attempting autonomous LLM-based decision-making.

## 🧠 Optional Mentions (if you want to go broader)

- **OpenAI Functions / Assistants API** – foundational, widely used for tool use and memory, but less about orchestration.
- **ReAct pattern** – not a platform, but a foundational *agent strategy* combining reasoning and acting, widely used across these platforms.

Let me know if you want to include a short “Recommended Agent Platforms” appendix or sidebar in the article. I can format that for you, too.
