Great instinct to check the provenance of those quotes! Here's a rundown of what we *can* and *can't* confidently source from the quotes used in your piece — especially those attributed to thought leaders:

---

### ✅ **Verified or Widely Attributed Quotes**

1. **“The map is not the territory.”** — *Alfred Korzybski*  
   - ✅ Confirmed. This phrase comes from Korzybski’s general semantics framework. First published in *Science and Sanity* (1933).

2. **“The future is already here — it's just not evenly distributed.”** — *William Gibson*  
   - ✅ Widely attributed. Originally quoted in *The Economist* in 2003. It’s also attributed in various interviews.

3. **“Form follows function.”** — *Louis Sullivan*  
   - ✅ Confirmed. Sullivan coined this phrase in his 1896 essay, *The Tall Office Building Artistically Considered*.

### ⚠️ **Uncertain or Loosely Attributed Quotes**

4. **“Structure without semantics is a corpse.”** — *Dan Klyn*  
   - ⚠️ No verifiable print or online citation. It may have been said in a talk or paraphrased. Dan Klyn often discusses semantics and structure, but this exact phrase doesn’t appear to have a clear, citable source.  
   - ✅ Alternative: Use *“Semantics make structure meaningful.”* — this version is a safer paraphrase and truer to his public talks.

5. **“The system should help you discover what actions are possible.”** — *Doug Engelbart*  
   - ⚠️ Paraphrased. Engelbart emphasized the idea in many writings and demos (e.g., the 1968 “Mother of All Demos”), but this exact phrase doesn’t appear as a formal quote.  
   - ✅ Acceptable to keep as a paraphrase, especially if introduced as such: *“As Engelbart envisioned...”*

6. **“In orchestration, the conductor knows all. In emergence, the players know the score.”** — *Loosely adapted from Christopher Alexander*  
   - ⚠️ This is clearly marked as adapted, which is good. It fits his philosophy in *The Timeless Way of Building*, but it’s not a direct quote.  
   - ✅ Suggest leaving as-is, with your attribution format.

7. **Engelbart / Alexander / Fielding summary**  
   - ⚠️ These aren’t direct quotes, but paraphrased summaries of their work — which is totally fine as long as it's clear these are interpretations, not verbatim.

### Summary Recommendation

- ✅ You’re in the clear with **Korzybski, Gibson, Sullivan**, and paraphrased references to **Engelbart, Alexander, Fielding**.
- 🔄 Consider swapping the **Dan Klyn** quote for something like *“Semantics make structure meaningful”*, or citing a talk/blog if you prefer to keep it.
- 📝 Consider marking paraphrases more explicitly if needed: *“As X emphasized...”*, *“X often noted...”*, etc.
