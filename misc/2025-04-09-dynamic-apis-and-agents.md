# Whitepaper Outline  
**Title:**  
**"From Static APIs to Dynamic Ecosystems: A Unified Architecture for Services, Jobs, and Agents"**

---

## Executive Summary
- Brief overview of the challenge: rigid APIs, fragile workflows, and siloed services
- The solution: a dynamic architecture combining common interfaces, job orchestration, and runtime discovery
- Key benefits: composability, adaptability, agent compatibility, and resilience

---

## 1. Introduction
- Why dynamic, late-bound systems are becoming essential
- The convergence of microservices and agent-based systems
- Goals: standardize service behavior, enable runtime orchestration, support discovery

---

## 2. Architectural Overview
- Diagram of the system (services + jobs + discovery)
- Three key pillars:
  1. Common Interface (Service Affordances)
  2. Declarative Job Composition (Task Coordination)
  3. Generalized Discovery Protocol (DISCO)

---

## 3. Common Interface: Designing for Composability
- The affordance model: `execute`, `repeat`, `revert`, etc.
- Hypermedia forms and action descriptions
- Shared state as a RESTful resource
- Predictability, safety, and agent readability

---

## 4. Jobs: Declarative Orchestration at Runtime
- Jobs as portable, resumable sequences of tasks
- Parallelism, conditions, and retries
- Shared state as memory across tasks
- Traceability with `correlation-id` and `request-id`

---

## 5. Discovery: Runtime Service Search and Binding
- The DISCO protocol: `register`, `find`, `bind`, `renew`, `health`
- Search fields: tags, media types, semantic profiles
- Bind tokens and ephemeral agreements
- Autonomous, adaptable service resolution

---

## 6. Use Cases
- Microservice workflows (e.g. checkout, provisioning)
- Agent-driven automation (e.g. self-configuring agents, LLM service planners)
- Fault-tolerant orchestrations with rollback and rerun
- Dynamic contract negotiation across service boundaries

---

## 7. Psychological Design: Helping Teams Embrace Change
- Addressing loss aversion and predictability bias
- Emphasizing familiar patterns (HTTP, JSON, forms)
- Avoiding reinvention with modular building blocks
- Why emergence â‰  chaos: safety by design

---

## 8. Implementation Patterns
- Reference implementation in Node.js
- Minimal affordance spec with ALPS
- Job definition DSL or format (JSON or YAML)
- Example DISCO registry and health pings

---

## 9. Future Directions
- Agent-native execution environments
- Multi-registry federation and trust layers
- Integration with policy engines or LLM planning modules
- Visualization tools for job state and service discovery

---

## Appendix
- Full ALPS vocabulary for the service interface
- DISCO OpenAPI and ALPS links
- Example job definition scripts
- Glossary of terms (affordance, bind token, etc.)
